# dodgersBatting
Ok I didn't very much like how the two best Dodger players hit this post-season, so I'm gonna figure out what went wrong.

This project is mainly a way for me to learn how all this data stuff works, but I also enjoy the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team.  Unofrutnately they played very poorly in the NLDS of the 2023 MLB postseason against the Arizona Diamondbacks despite winning the division pennant in which they competed with Arizona.  The Dodgers' two star hitters are Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, yet they did not show their skill in the three games that were played by going a combined 1 out of 21 batting appearances.  I want to know what went wrong and how the Dodgers may avoid another offensive slump next year.
